# Riichi UI CSS

CSS library designed to facilitate the creation of riichi mahjong-related applications. This library offers a collection of CSS styles without any dependency on JavaScript, providing a foundational layer for building interfaces and UI components.

## Purpose

This library aims to serve as a fundamental, low-level resource, leveraging only CSS and HTML. However, for more advanced and comprehensive functionality, we highly recommend exploring our more feature-rich library:

## Primary Use-cases
- **Foundation for Higher-Level UI Components:** Ideal for establishing a groundwork for a more advanced UI component library utilizing sophisticated JavaScript frameworks.
- **HTML/CSS-Only Projects:** Suited for projects where JavaScript is not utilized or required.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the library via your preferred package manager (NPM, Yarn, PNPM, etc...):

```bash
npm install @emeraldcoder/riichi-ui-css
```

### Implementation

Reference the library's CSS file within your page or component:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@emeraldcoder/riichi-ui-css/build/riichi-ui.min.css">
```

Utilize CSS classes to incorporate the library's components:

```html
<span class="riichi-tile">
  <span class="riichi-tile-icon riichi-tile-icon--1m"></span>
</span>
```
